# Hand(held Analog) Refractometer

> For now, we use information provided from Wikipedia as placeholder. will be replaced later

A traditional handheld refractometer is a type of refractometer, an analog instrument for measuring a liquid's refractive index.

It works on the critical angle principle by which lenses and prisms project a shadow line onto a small glass reticle inside the instrument, which is then viewed by the user through a magnifying eyepiece.
They are less precise than Digital handheld refractometers.

In use, a sample is placed between a measuring prism and a small cover plate.ss
Light traveling through the sample is either passed through to the reticle or totally internally reflected.

[Developer:] Hand Refractometer is used in marine science to measure salinity in general.

## Procedure

The general procedur when operating a handheld refractometer is started with [1] opening the cover, then make sure the value shown is zero by [2] calibrating it via dispensing aquades on the prism, then [3] wipe the prism one-way gently, you may want to make sure by peeking into the eyepiece. After that, [4] you sample the liquid/water and dispense it on the prism, one drop is enough, Then [5] close the cover. To see the salinity value of this liquid, [6] point the prism to a light source, then [7] peek into the eyepiece.

### How to Use the Interface

1. Open Cover

    ![Show Open Button](show_openbutton.png)

    This button replicates the action of opening the cover of the hand refractometer.

2. Calibrate via Dispensing Aquades

    ![Show Calibrate Button](show_calibratebutton.png)

    This button replicates the action of dispensing aquades on the prism.

3. Wipe the prism

    ![Show Wipe Button](show_wipebutton.png)

    This button replicates the action of wiping the prism one-way gently.

4. Sample the water and drop it on the prism

    ![Show Sample Button](show_samplebutton.png)

    This button replicates the action of sampling the target water, and then dispense it on the prism.

5. Close cover

    ![Show Close Button](show_closebutton.png)

    This button replicates the action of closing the cover of the hand refractometer

6. Point the prism to a light source

    ![Show Point to Light Button](show_pointtolightbutton.png)

    This button replicates the action of pointing the prism of a hand refractometer to a light source. Clicking this button will run a timer which decrease the visibility when you peeking.

7. Peek into eyepiece

    ![Show Peek Button](show_peekbutton.png)

    This button replicates the action of peeking into the eyepiece of the hand refractometer.
